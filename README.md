# CIFAR
# Objectives
The goal of this project is to identify and explore interesting aspects of data in the image recognition processing.

The project will consist of the following tasks:
•	Analyzing data and selecting the model best suited to solve the problem.
•	Implementing and optimizing algorithms.
•	Using Python to perform computations and analyze the results.
•	Creating a slide deck describing the process.


# Project Problem - Classification
Given numerous images, I create an image recognition algorithm to accurately identify images and explore how these images are related. I Identify and discusse interesting aspects of the data and optimize an algorithm to correctly identify images with the lowest possible error rate.
I use the CIFAR-10 image dataset (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), a widely used dataset for machine learning and image recognition. The data consists of 10 classes of images: airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. Each of the images are 32x32 color pixels with 6,000 images per class.
The original problem included 50,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing. 
For this project, I formulate a binary classification to solve with this dataset. I will pick two classes of images for this problem.
